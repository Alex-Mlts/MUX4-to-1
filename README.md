# VHDL code for a 4-to-1 MUX 👨‍💻

Implementing a 4-to-1 MUX as seen in the following circuit, in **VHDL** code *(structual description)*, with the help of a 2-to-4 decoder and the needed AND/OR gates.

----
The project was given as homework for the lesson ***CS:321*** of University of Thessaly - Computer science & telecommunications 🎓.
