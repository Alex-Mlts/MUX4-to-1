# VHDL code for a 4-to-1 MUX 👨‍💻

Implementing a 4-to-1 MUX as seen in the following circuit, in **VHDL** code *(structual description)*, with the help of a 2-to-4 decoder and the needed AND/OR gates.

## Code info

MUX 4-to-1.vhd is the main code where we connect all the components (Decoder, AND gates, OR gate) and make the MUX that is asked.

### Tech Stack

VHDL
